# 10. Given a number line from -infinity to +infinity.
# You start at 0 and can go either to the left or to the right.
# The condition is that in iâ€™th move, you take i steps.
# In the first move take 1 step, second move 2 steps and so on. 
# 
# Hint:
#      3 can be reached in 2 steps (0, 1) (1, 3).
#      2 can be reached in 3 steps (0, 1) (1,-1) (-1, 2)
#
# a) Find the optimal number of steps to reach position 1000000000 and -1000000000.
